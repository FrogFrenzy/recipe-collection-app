# Getting Started with Your Recipe Collection App üöÄ

Congratulations on building your first app! Here's everything you need to know to run and deploy it.

## Running Locally

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd recipe-collection-app
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. **Try it out:**
   - Click "Add Recipe" to create your first recipe
   - Search and filter recipes
   - Click on any recipe to view details, edit, or delete

## Understanding the Code

### Key Files to Explore

- **`app/page.tsx`** - Home page showing all recipes
- **`app/add/page.tsx`** - Form to add new recipes
- **`app/recipe/[id]/page.tsx`** - Individual recipe page
- **`components/`** - Reusable UI components
- **`lib/storage.ts`** - Functions to save/load recipes from browser
- **`lib/types.ts`** - TypeScript definitions for recipes

### How Data Works

Your recipes are saved in your browser's **localStorage**. This means:
- ‚úÖ Data persists when you refresh the page
- ‚úÖ No backend or database needed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data is local to your browser only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clearing browser data will delete recipes

## Deploy to Vercel (FREE!)

### Method 1: Deploy via GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Create a GitHub account** (if you don't have one): [github.com](https://github.com)

2. **Create a new repository:**
   - Go to github.com and click "New repository"
   - Name it `recipe-collection-app`
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have one)

3. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   cd recipe-collection-app
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Recipe Collection App"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/recipe-collection-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Deploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up (use your GitHub account)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your `recipe-collection-app` repository
   - Click "Deploy" (Vercel auto-detects all settings!)
   - Wait ~1 minute for deployment

5. **Done!** Your app is now live at `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### Method 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy
cd recipe-collection-app
vercel
```

Follow the prompts, and your app will be deployed!

## Next Steps & Ideas

### Easy Enhancements
1. **Add more categories** - Edit `lib/types.ts` to add "appetizers", "drinks", etc.
2. **Change colors** - Modify the gradient colors in components
3. **Add a footer** - Create a `Footer.tsx` component
4. **Add recipe images** - Use URLs for now (store image URL in recipe)

### Intermediate Challenges
1. **Favorite recipes** - Add a star button and filter favorites
2. **Print recipe** - Add a print-friendly view
3. **Import/Export** - Download/upload recipes as JSON
4. **Tags** - Add multiple tags per recipe (e.g., "quick", "vegetarian")

### Advanced Projects
1. **Add a database** - Use Supabase or Firebase for cloud storage
2. **User authentication** - Let multiple users have their own collections
3. **Share recipes** - Generate shareable links
4. **Recipe ratings** - Add a 5-star rating system
5. **Meal planner** - Calendar view to plan weekly meals

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use?**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and try:
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

**Build errors?**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Styling not working?**
- Make sure `tailwind.config.ts` includes all your component paths
- Check that `globals.css` has the Tailwind directives
