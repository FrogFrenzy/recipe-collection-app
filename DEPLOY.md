git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/recipe-collection-app.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Important Notes

‚úÖ **Data Storage:** Remember, recipes are stored in **browser localStorage**
   - Each user has their own local collection
   - Data doesn't sync between devices
   - To add a real database later, consider Supabase or Firebase

‚úÖ **Zero Config:** Vercel automatically:
   - Detects Next.js
   - Configures build settings
   - Sets up CDN and SSL
   - Enables automatic deployments

‚úÖ **Free Tier Includes:**
   - Unlimited deployments
   - Automatic HTTPS
   - Global CDN
   - Preview deployments for PRs

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails on Vercel?**
- Check that build works locally: `npm run build`
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check Vercel build logs for specific errors

**App works locally but not on Vercel?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify no hardcoded `localhost` URLs
- localStorage works the same on deployed apps

**Need to redeploy?**
- Just push to GitHub - auto deploys!
- Or click "Redeploy" in Vercel dashboard

---

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Share your app** - Send the Vercel URL to friends/family!
2. **Set up custom domain** - Make it yours (optional)
3. **Monitor analytics** - Vercel provides built-in analytics
4. **Add features** - See `GETTING_STARTED.md` for ideas
